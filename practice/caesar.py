'''
A Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher in which each letter of the plain text is substituted with a
letter found by moving n places down the alphabet. For example, assume the input plain text is the following:

abcd xyz
If the shift value, n, is 4, then the encrypted text would be the following:

efgh bcd
You are to write a function that accepts two arguments, a plain-text message and a number of letters to shift in the cipher.
 The function will return an encrypted string with all letters transformed and all punctuation and whitespace remaining unchanged.
